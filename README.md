# Project-Error

This Solidity program is an error testing program that demonstrates the require(), assert(), and revert() statements in Solidity. This program is
a partial requirement for the ETH PROOF: Intermediate EVM Course.

## Description

This program is written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts in the Ethereum blockchain. The program has three functions: testRequire(), where it tests the require() error statement; testAssert(), where it tests the assert() error statement; and testRevert(), where it tests the revert() error statement. 

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, I recommend using Remix, an online IDE for Solidity. To open, click the link here: https://remix.ethereum.org/.

After getting started, create a file by clicking "File explorer' tab and then look for the icon that has the name "Create a new file". You can name the file
to anything you want as long as it ends with ".sol" as the file name.

After creating a file, go back to my root folder. Look for the file "projectError.sol", then open it. Copy and paste the code inside to your file. 

Then, to comply the code, look for the "Solidity compiler" tab on the left side. Simply click on the button "Compile *file name*." Or you could simply use the
shortcut ctrl+s.

After compiling, click the "Deploy and run transactions" tab below the compiler tab. Simply click the "Deply" button, then scroll down to see the "Deployed
Contracts". Click the right arrow beside the name of the contract. 

To run the program, simply click on the "testAssert" button. For the rest of the functions, simply enter a number. If the number is below 5, it will display an error message. Otherwise, the function will work.
